#### Jamstack

_architecture_ designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale.
The core principles of pre-rendering, and decoupling

##### pre-rendering aka static web generation

during this phase the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This results in sites which can be served directly from a CDN.
example of SW generators: Next Js, Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, Nuxt

server-side dynamic web page
construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts.

A client-side dynamic web page
processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads
react

#### client-side vs server-side

_Client-side_ means that the action takes place on the user's _local device_.
Typically, a client is a computer application, such as a web browser

> Markup languages like HTML and CSS are interpreted by the browser on the client side. _JavaScript_ is a client-side script, meaning the browser processes the code instead of the web server.

_Server-side_ means that the action takes place on a _server_. A server is a computer application, such as a web server, that runs on a remote server, reachable from a user's local device. Operations may be performed server-side because they require access to information or functionality that is not available on the client

> examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript

Node. js is a server-side open source JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers run JavaScript code on the server. Node uses Google's V8 engine---libUV---to deliver cross-platform compatibility and a core library.

### languages, javascript and what side their on?

_javascript_ is a language. A language is just a way of writing commands. There is no inherent use-case in a language.
Historically, JavaScript has been written to be interpreted by the browser. This is why it's called a client-side language. The browser is the client. The server is the server.
In recent times, a new toolkit has gained rapid adoption called Node.JS. Node runs on the server, and does server-y things.
Node.JS runs on the server. Vanilla JavaScript runs on the client. Thus, in this day age, JavaScript can be and is used both server side and client side.
